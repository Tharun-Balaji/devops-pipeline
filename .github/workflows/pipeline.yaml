# Trigger configuration: defines when this workflow should run
on:
  # This workflow triggers on push events (when code is pushed to the repository)
  push:
    # Specifies that the workflow only runs when code is pushed to the 'main' branch
    branches: [main]

# Jobs section: contains all the jobs that will be executed in this workflow
jobs:
  # Job name: 'build' - this is the identifier for this job
  build:
    # Specifies the type of machine/runner that will execute this job
    # ubuntu-latest: uses the latest version of Ubuntu Linux as the execution environment
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps section: ordered list of tasks that will be executed sequentially in this job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout code
      # name: Human-readable name for this step that appears in workflow logs
      - name: Checkout code
        # uses: specifies a pre-built GitHub Action to use
        # actions/checkout@v5: officially maintained action that checks out the repository code
        # This allows the workflow to access and work with the source code
        uses: actions/checkout@v5

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js runtime environment
      # This step installs Node.js and npm in the runner environment
      - name: Set up Node.js
        # actions/setup-node@v3: GitHub's official action for setting up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        # with: provides configuration options for the action
        with:
          # node-version: specifies which version of Node.js to install
          # "16": installs Node.js version 16 for running JavaScript code
          node-version: "16"

      # Step 3: Install project dependencies
      # This step installs all npm packages listed in package.json
      - name: Install dependencies
        # run: executes a shell command directly (not a GitHub Action)
        # npm install: downloads and installs all dependencies specified in package.json
        run: npm install

      # Step 4: Run automated tests
      # This step executes the test suite to verify the application works correctly
      - name: Test Application
        # run: executes a shell command
        # npm test: runs the test script defined in package.json to validate the code
        run: npm test
